00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:07,816
I’d bet a whole heap of ore 

9
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:12,553
no one in the damn Guard expected what was coming this morning.

10
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:15,014
Things got ugly...

11
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:17,065
[laugh]

12
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:21,809
Who’d have thought Gomez would kill him out of rage, huh?

13
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,853
I wonder if Markus would've smoked less swampweed last night 

14
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,868
if he knew, what was coming for him?

00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:29,724
[scoffs]

16
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:33,296
Nothing else mattered to that lazy pig anyway...

17
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:34,815
He brought it on himself! 

18
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:37,425
Letting someone snatch a baron's ring 

19
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:42,479
and a sack of ore from Gomez's chest? That's beyond sloppy.

20
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,142
You're either the thief 

21
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:50,620
or you're only good for picking mushrooms for Snaf!

22
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,262
If it were just about the ore, maybe he'd still be breathing...

23
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:56,946
But the signet?

24
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,630
That's a whole other thing...

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,636
Besides me and Gomez, 

26
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:05,018
only a few of Mages could recognise that ancient artefact.

27
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:07,073
Supposedly, it's a Ring of Power 

28
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:11,082
handed down by the barons who lived in this Castle. 

29
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:14,796
It always scared me and made me feel obey. 

30
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:17,566
Whatever magic's inside

31
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:20,259
- only Gomez himself knows.

32
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:24,461
I remember when he pulled it off the last old Camp leader's finger,

33
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,294
that was right after the Barrier went up, 

34
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:30,376
back when we diggers were busy slaughtering the old rulers in the Colony.

35
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:33,425
He realized its power almost right away.

36
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,528
I was there when he found it. 

37
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:39,106
And I saw how fast

38
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:42,132
that shiny trinket got him to the very top!

39
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:45,769
That signet could've been mine... 

40
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,623
And the old bastard knows it.

41
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:50,848
I've never given him a reason not to trust me, 

42
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:53,592
but things ain't the same anymore. 

43
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,267
Lately he's become suspicious. 

44
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,754
Too much info leaking out.

45
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:01,833
What's got into his head? 

46
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,256
To pick me, for this investigation? 

47
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:08,460
He never gave me such a task before...

48
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,163
This whole thing smells worse than a bunch of sweaty Mercenaries!

49
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:16,714
[soft music]

50
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:21,620
A man thinks that after all these years of busting his ass, something's changed.

51
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,031
That he's earned a position, some trust!

52
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:30,380
Then a day like this comes, and the only thing you can count on,

53
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,274
are the hungry lurkers in the river

54
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:37,609
and angry Gomez waiting to feed them 

55
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:41,448
the only Guard who knows about the ring!

56
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:44,539
But damn Beliar if I'm going down that easy!

57
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,358
Well... let's think... 

58
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,594
Not many options here. 

59
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,266
Can't rule out Lares and his New Camp rats, 

60
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:54,909
though I doubt even there would dare try such a bold theft. 

61
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,309
And the Brotherhood freaks...? 

62
00:03:57,309 --> 00:04:00,404
They never cared much about material goods

63
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:03,788
- except swampweed in their joints.

64
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,912
Hmm... We've had lately 

65
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,187
a growing problem with smuggling gangs, here in the Colony. 

66
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:13,234
Mostly run by ex-thief diggers

67
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,288
but their leaders stay in the shadows.

68
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,846
I wouldn't be surprised if 

69
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:21,187
some of them held important positions in each of the Camps.

70
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:24,655
Those cockroaches definately must have connections everywhere,

71
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,321
and they could've slipped Markus some

72
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:30,522
fake weed and gotten him high out of his mind...

73
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:33,122
How else could he lose it so badly?

74
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,743
When they found him this morning, clutching a burn-out joint, 

75
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,516
he was still high as hell.

76
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:41,539
A lot of people knew he smoked on duty; 

77
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:45,519
wouldn't be too hard for an outsider to figure that out.

78
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,918
There's been a story going around the Guard for a while 

79
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,423
about that fool 

80
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:53,720
passing out with a lit joint while sitting on Gomez's throne. 

81
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,685
Shakal came there for something at night 

82
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,908
and found the throne with a big burn hole.

83
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,231
that it burned a damn hole in the throne. 

84
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:05,100
Gomez was ready to whip him good for that,

85
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,945
but since Markus was Thorus's kin 

86
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:14,232
he smoothed it over somehow and the whole thing got buried.

87
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,469
That runt got a bit more careful after that

88
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:18,638
but I'd bet anything 

89
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:22,168
he'd still gladly try any new stuff

90
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,587
they put under his nose.

91
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:25,783
[sigh]

92
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:29,645
Years in this damn Colony taught me one thing: 

93
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,808
you can find any information 

94
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:35,062
if you know where to dig.

95
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:38,428
Whats better place in the Old Camp

96
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,575
to shift stolen goods 

97
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:41,963
than the bloody tavern? 

98
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:44,167
Half of the Colony goes through there every day!

99
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,654
Perfect spot 

100
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:48,293
to dump something that's not yours.

101
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,991
As a tavern keeper, you could, of course report 

102
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,764
every suspected crime to the Guards... 

103
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:55,560
Unless you're 

104
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,053
always in debt and broke, 

105
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,852
and every scumbag in Colony 

106
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:01,964
can pay for your silence!

107
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:04,426
That trash makes me sick!

108
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,836
[spit]

109
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:10,622
He didn't know much but enough for me.

110
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,399
Apparently there is a stash in the tavern. 

111
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,674
They forbade him from looking inside, 

112
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,167
but in the evening, someone left something there 

113
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,009
and by morning it was gone.

114
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,318
That bloody Novice is always hanging here day and night,

115
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:24,528
selling swampweed! 

116
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:27,170
Let's see if showing Gomez's seal

117
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,688
reminds him of anyone 

118
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,184
sneaking around this morning!

119
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,704
By the Rhobar's piss! 

120
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,869
That was easier then I thought!

121
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,405
If the words of this swamp rat are to be believed, 

122
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:41,672
some ragged bastard - one of those dirty diggers 

123
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,490
was acting fishy near the tavern

124
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,382
early in the morning, 

125
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:48,055
before shift even started.

126
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:52,177
Caught his eye since most diggers go to the tavern after work, 

127
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,223
not before! 

128
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,760
The guy went in for a moment and came out 

129
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,931
with a sack over his shoulder! 

130
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:01,954
Didn't remember his face so probably was someone new!

131
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,016
Damn rats! 

132
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,465
There is nothing left for me to do

133
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:09,546
but check every single digger from the morning shift.

134
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,458
If I'm right, they should still be in the mine! 

135
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,276
They'll start singing soon enough! 

136
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:17,988
Time to tighten the screws down there, 

137
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:20,828
maybe feed a few to the minecrawlers, 

138
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:23,529
- remind them who's in charge!

139
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,857
Gomez needs to start dealing with these gangs too! 

140
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:29,857
They're popping up like Hell mushrooms after rain. 

141
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:33,194
If any of them is responsible for what happened today,

142
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:37,375
it's time to wiped this plague out of the Old Camp! 

143
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,862
One by one!

144
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:39,721
[sigh]

145
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,876
Alright, there's the Mine.

146
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,333
Let's see what happens next.

147
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,053
Gotta ask Maxim about the morning shift.

148
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,989
[guttural laughter]

149
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,665
Well, well,

150
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:53,026
what a turn of events!

151
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:55,797
Two of them didn't show up, huh?

152
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:59,192
They left the Camp with the rest, 

153
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,968
but never made it to the Mine. 

154
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,772
Well, this makes things a lot easier.

155
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:07,533
Just need to check the damn attendance list now.

156
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:08,863
If this keeps up, 

157
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,227
to do wieczora całą tą sprawę będę miał z głowy! 

158
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:13,971
[nerwowy śmiech]

159
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,403
Ugh, all this has made me hungry! 

160
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:19,755
The investigation's going so well,  I think I've earned myself a break!

161
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:22,890
Time for a meal at Snaf's!

162
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,739
Need to think what to do next. 

163
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,870
Those two could be anywhere by now.

164
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,901
[sigh]

165
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:34,211
Probably best to head back give Gomez the initial report 

166
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:37,251
Figure out who exactly didn't show up for the shift,

167
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,425
and then post bounties in all the Camps.

168
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:43,973
But... Damn it!

169
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:47,372
He's probably already suspicious that I might be involved in the theft! 

170
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:51,077
I can't just go back and point two random diggers! 

171
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:53,823
He could just as easily think I made it all up! 

172
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:55,790
I need to find some proof…

173
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,787
[music]

174
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,973
Bloody Gomez!

175
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:01,012
This is how he repays me for years of service?

176
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,982
I was his trusted Guard, 

177
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:06,989
and now I'm chasing dirty diggers through the woods!

178
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:08,524
To hell with his damn ring! 

179
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:09,849
Let him find it himself!

180
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,690
I'll go back, stand before him, and tell him straight to his face: 

181
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,214
"Listen here, you damn...!"  [cuts off]

182
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:15,946
Hey! By Gomez's mother! 

183
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,534
That's Drago 

184
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:18,591
from Old Castle!

185
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,024
What's he even doing here?

186
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:23,480
Weird... Coming back from New Camp?

187
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,996
Says he was walking the path 

188
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,602
and heard two diggers arguing in the woods? 

189
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:30,296
He says he crept closer, 

190
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:33,601
heard them talking about the ore stolen from Gomez,

191
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,033
then stepped in! 

192
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,801
As soon as he found a bag with them,

193
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,228
beat them up so badly 

194
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,889
that he's not even sure if they're still alive! 

195
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,507
He was running to the Camp to find me

196
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:44,515
and bring more Guards!

197
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,460
[sigh]

198
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,902
Thank Innos! 

199
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:50,352
Soon this mess will be over

200
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:53,051
and things will go back to normal!

201
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,697
Gomez'll say to me: "Gniewny"

202
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:58,070
"You're my most loyal Guard!" 

203
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,347
That's how it'll be, by Beliar!

204
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:01,747
After

205
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,309
a day like this, 

206
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:06,560
I've earned myself to get properly wasted!

207
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,975
There they are!

208
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,802
They took a real beating!

209
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:12,052
Looks like they're already dead! 

210
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,842
Let's see if they've got the ring...

211
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,681
Damn it, nothing...

212
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,021
Maybe it's on 'em?

213
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,501
Better search and...

214
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,550
[whack]

215
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,134
[thud]

216
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:25,777
[heavy breathing]

217
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:27,871
What... the...?

218
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:32,906
[gasp and cry of pain]

219
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:36,001
[soft dark music]

220
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,098
I never liked that ugly face.

221
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:43,732
Him and the rest of the Guards are a bunch of damn clowns.

222
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,338
Useless for anything 

223
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:49,265
but sleeping, drinking, and pretending to be tough!

224
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:51,862
Arrogant scum! 

225
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:54,999
Bet it never even crossed their minds 

226
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:59,515
who was really behind the ring theft.

227
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,821
Who might have had an interest in taking it 

228
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:04,366
to weaken the Gomez's position?

229
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:07,732
Must've been those ragged bastards from the mine, right? 

230
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,870
[laughter]

231
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,704
Logical thinking is beyond the Guards' abilities.

232
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:18,457
All it took was to leave them a few dubious leads 

233
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:21,187
and they pounced on them like dogs, 

234
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:26,168
blaming each other and chasing after the two idiots I set up.

235
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:28,818
[sigh] Lares was right. 

236
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,970
He predicted every move...

237
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,855
Planned it out pretty damn well...

238
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:40,219
[cicha muzyka]

239
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:43,734
First, he told me to go to Lukas. 

240
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:46,144
That bastard knows what he's doing. 

241
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:50,064
A solid guy who knows when to keep his mouth shut.

242
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,214
I told him that in exactly two days,

243
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:57,380
the moment Markus showed up - like he always did before his shift

244
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,130
he'd sell that damn smoker 

245
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,937
a little specialty from New Camp [laughter]

246
00:12:03,937 --> 00:12:06,582
Markus took the bait so easily, 

247
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:09,671
you'd think he just got dumped in the Colony yesterday. 

248
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:12,334
Whatever was left in his head 

249
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:15,280
must've burned out long ago.

250
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:21,654
Then I had to find those two ambitious diggers 

251
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,119
- the ones who always kept to themselves

252
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,618
and once tried to rob a sleeping Mercenary! 

253
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:31,813
Lucky for them, he was completely drunk! 

254
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,433
Thought it was so funny 

255
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:36,791
he just told them to get their asses back to the mine

256
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,024
and never show their ugly faces again

257
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:43,690
unless they wanted to spend the rest of their lives digging ore with their teeth!

258
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,274
When I told them I was coming on behalf of the gang 

259
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,890
and secretly offered them a role in a heist on Gomez's Castle, 

260
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,668
those damn fools near started sweating from excitement! 

261
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:59,486
I gave them one simple order - take just one thing 

262
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:00,738
from the room.

263
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,710
A big sack of ore. 

264
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,094
Nothing more, nothing less.

265
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,363
"If you pull it off" 

266
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,535
I said, 

267
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:12,439
"you'll get your cut and earn the gang's respect"

268
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:15,643
They didn't even ask how much. 

269
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:17,466
That was enough for them! 

270
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:21,400
I promised them everything would be set, 

271
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,752
I’d take care of the Guard on duty,

272
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:26,626
and on my signal, they’d sneak in

273
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,285
through the back. 

274
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:31,198
The loot was to be stashed in the tavern 

275
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:34,956
and smuggled out of the Camp in the morning, during the march to the Mine.

276
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:38,060
I had my doubts 

277
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,831
— those fools weren’t exactly blessed with brains

278
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,416
but Lares insisted they’d manage with me watching over them. 

279
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,146
So, I had no say in it.

280
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:50,307
Luckily, this was going to be

281
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,511
their last adventure. [laughter]

282
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,891
[thunder]

283
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:56,871
When the day of the theft came, 

284
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,740
I was the one on duty before Markus. 

285
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,622
I had given Lares a full breakdown of Gomez’s daily routine

286
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:05,927
and the Guards’ shifts, so everything was planned down

287
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:10,292
to the last detail—making sure I’d be in the right place at the right time.

288
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:14,243
In other words, my shift ended just before dusk 

289
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:18,090
right when Gomez took off his ring and locked it away in his chest,

290
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,368
moments before heading to bed.

291
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:23,211
I’d seen him do it plenty of times.

292
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:26,239
I guess wearing that signet ring day and night 

293
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:28,528
must be too tiring.

294
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:32,020
[sound of a lockpick]

295
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,479
I waited a moment after he left... 

296
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:38,803
Then I picked the lock on the chest and grabbed that little treasure!

297
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,653
Not long after, Markus came on shift.

298
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,267
An hour was all it took. 

299
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,833
He got bored of standing around, 

300
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,988
pulled out his daily dose of swampweed,

301
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,462
and lit up…

302
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,621
[thump]

303
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,160
The diggers slipped in, 

304
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,967
grabbed the ore, and made it look like a simple robbery. 

305
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,643
Meanwhile, Markus 

306
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:06,000
had probably already joined the Sleeper 

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in some distant lands. [laugh]

308
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,042
I watched them haul the loot to the tavern 

309
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,230
and stash it in the hideout.

310
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,231
Saw them sit down, 

311
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,171
call for drinks, and start gulping down their ale 

312
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,697
likely chatting about what they had just done.

313
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,852
Didn’t really care. 

314
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:28,904
Their time was running out anyway. 

315
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:31,864
But I preferred to keep things under control.

316
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,198
The innkeeper was watching them too. 

317
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:36,177
He’s one of ours. 

318
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,395
If they started running their mouths too much,

319
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:42,140
he was ready to slip some dreamweed extract into their beer

320
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,818
and put them to sleep.

321
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,145
At dawn the next day, 

322
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:50,116
those idiots were supposed to grab the stash from the hideout 

323
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,069
and leave the Camp with the rest of the diggers.

324
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,757
I had set a meeting point in the forest.

325
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,121
When they showed up, I checked the loot, 

326
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,101
congratulated them for a well done job, 

327
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:05,040
and handed each of them a bottle of beer—to celebrate the heist. 

328
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,726
While they drank, 

329
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:10,136
I pretended to count out their share of ore nuggets.

330
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,926
No idea if they even noticed the bitter taste. 

331
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,714
But anyway,

332
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:18,633
after the first sip, it was already too late. 

333
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:22,118
Swamp snake venom. 

334
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,389
Paralyzes and kills. 

335
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,615
A specialty of the Swamp Camp—if you know who to ask.

336
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:30,928
Moments like this always

337
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:33,366
make me think: if they’re dying,

338
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:37,040
it means Innos willed it. 

339
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,279
Otherwise, He would’ve stopped it, right?

340
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,072
Those fools should be grateful to me.

341
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:46,026
The only thing I hate is cleaning up after jobs like this. 

342
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:49,914
But everything had to be ready before Gniewny showed up.

343
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,673
Yeah… Lares knew exactly 

344
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:57,234
who Gomez would send for this task.

345
00:16:57,234 --> 00:17:01,603
The only person who would truly fall under suspicion. 

346
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,272
An old comrade who stood by his side faithfully for years, 

347
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:09,423
yet for some reason was never made a Magnate or promoted.

348
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:12,307
a Magnate or promoted.

349
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:16,083
And since he’d long suspected betrayal within his ranks, 

350
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,081
with too much information leaking out,

351
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,710
it was easy to connect the dots. 

352
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,291
Why would he pay attention 

353
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,440
to a quiet and loyal Guard like me?

354
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,794
Far more likely 

355
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,932
that an old friend, who hadn’t basked

356
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:36,000
in glory all these years,

357
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,490
was slowly turning his back on him!

358
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,762
But to kill him without evidence, like any other trash…? 

359
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,508
No... no, no no...

360
00:17:45,508 --> 00:17:48,435
He had to give him one last chance

361
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,760
to prove his guilt or innocence.

362
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,654
When a drunk Fire Mage named Derry, 

363
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:57,747
let slip long time ago that Gomez owed his power

364
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:00,109
to some ancient artifact, 

365
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:04,325
I knew I'd just heard something very importand.

366
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:07,501
Lares immediately pushed me to find out 

367
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:09,387
exactly what he meant. 

368
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:13,932
Derry always had access to secrets known only to the Mages, 

369
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:17,004
that's why this could be something big.

370
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:19,761
So later on, 

371
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:22,096
I got Derry, swiped from a transport to the Colony 

372
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:24,386
a shipment of Dark Paladin 

373
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:28,187
Then I spent the whole night drinking with him, 

374
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,905
bottle after bottle,

375
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:33,654
trying to loosen his tongue. 

376
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:38,165
Finally, just before dawn, 

377
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:41,311
he told me about the ring Gomez wears

378
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,503
and why a certain Guard, if he wanted to, 

379
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:47,465
could cause him a lot of trouble…

380
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:52,566
He swore me to secrecy, told me never to speak of it to anyone. 

381
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:56,354
Of course buddy, sure thing! [laughter]

382
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:59,255
That was the kind of information I’d been waiting for all these years... 

383
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:02,278
Finally, there was a chance to avenge

384
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:05,029
my little sister... 

385
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,403
who was sent here with me long ago and...

386
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,302
...get back at Gomez.

387
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:15,941
My beloved sister ended up as his whore…

388
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:18,852
He didn’t spare her... oh no... 

389
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,709
And all I could do was listen to stories about her 

390
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,635
from beyond the Castle walls... 

391
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,740
Because back then… I was nobody…

392
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,626
All because of me and my debts... 

393
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,931
I wasn’t enough to pay them back. 

394
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,761
So they took her too.

395
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,650
And when she died… 

396
00:19:39,204 --> 00:19:42,297
I knew Lares was the only one who could help me.

397
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:46,952
Thanks to him, I finally drove a knife into that old snake’s back! 

398
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,304
Let’s see how he fares now—without his magic!

399
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:52,111
So many years...!

400
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:54,710
I've been waiting for this for so many years! 

401
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,458
I’ve got a feeling that soon, everything in the Colony is going to change!

402
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,166
And it all starts 

403
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,908
with that trash losing his position…!

404
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:06,382
Look, sister! This is all for you!

405
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,160
…We’ll watch in peace 

406
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,905
as you butcher each other in the Old Camp!

407
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:18,405
Everything has been prepared...

408
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:27,785
[dark laughter]

409
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:32,008
