1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,681
So, you're new here, boy?

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:07,132
You must be favored by the Sleeper to end up with me. 

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,892
The second shift throws fresh meat like you straight into tunnels

4
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:13,792
dangerously close to the Minecrawler's nests... 

5
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:16,217
You wouldn't want to end up there, believe me.

6
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,565
You're asking how long I've been here? 

7
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:22,045
Too long, boy, too long. 

8
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:25,072
Let me give you some advice - don't stick your neck out. 

9
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:27,269
Those who do, end up badly. 

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,305
Don't make that mistake!

11
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,989
You've got a honest face

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,571
- a rare sight in the Colony. 

13
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:36,834
People like you are an easy prey here.

14
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,669
I know what I'm talking about...

15
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:40,090
You're looking into eyes 

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,146
that have seen a lot.

17
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,102
A few years ago, I was on my way 

18
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:47,674
to becoming someone important...

19
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:50,475
I was supposed to become a Temple Guardian... 

20
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:53,394
But that's in the past now.

21
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:56,273
Hard to believe, isn't it? 

22
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,922
You're probably wondering how 

23
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:01,126
I ended up in this hole, then? 

24
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:02,506
The answer is simple:

25
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:05,695
I tread on someoneâ€™s toes. 

26
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:07,941
But let me explain.

27
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,760
The Sleeper promised us freedom

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,478
and after a few years in this damned prison

29
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,440
a man is willing to believe anything 

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,811
just to escape.

31
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,956
Some join the Swamp Camp

32
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:26,970
for the swamp weed, and I won't lie, 

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,244
that's what attracted me at first too... 

34
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:33,000
The weed does wonders for your mind,

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,009
 you understand...

36
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:39,742
But over time, I started feeling really good there.

37
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:42,954
It was like I found a new home... 

38
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:46,615
Life in the Brotherhood flows very peacefully... 

39
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:49,930
Gurus preach the teachings sent by the Sleeper,

40
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,496
we pray

41
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,571
Brothers help each other

42
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:58,410
we process swamp herbs

43
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,419
and in our free time, we meditate

44
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:04,492
to reach higher states of consciousness 

45
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:07,321
and open up to new visions.

46
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,267
Novices like me back then 

47
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:14,570
travel a lot around the Colony, selling the weed.

48
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:18,948
You can see a lot 

49
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:21,867
when they let you into every Camp.

50
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:25,647
My favorite place has always been the Old Camp. 

51
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:28,708
There's always something happening there, regardless of the time of day.

52
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,590
People from all over the Colony gather there.

53
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,817
If you want to do some business,

54
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:36,780
that's the best place to do it.

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,475
Not that it's always safe,

56
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:41,224
Far from it,

57
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:43,195
 even the most important Ore Barons

58
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,302
 have to be cautious.

59
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:46,769
Do you know why?

60
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,282
Because Gomez sees everything.

61
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:52,834
May the Sleeper protect anyone 

62
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,888
who dares to try to cheat him!

63
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:59,729
I remember when he sentenced one of the Ore Baron to lifelong imprisonment 

64
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,475
in the Mine for alleged theft. 

65
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:04,303
Lifelong, boy. Yes, yes!

66
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:06,727
You have to be careful in the Colony!

67
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:08,647
No one is safe.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,633
The Guards and Shadows, even though often young, 

69
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,793
are ruthless 

70
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:17,003
and loyal to Gomez in most cases.

71
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:18,763
If you were to ask 

72
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:22,309
me whether you should try your luck in the New Camp?

73
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:23,740
I would tell you,

74
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,495
definitely not with that innocent face of yours. 

75
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:31,652
It's not a place for people like you!

76
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:33,734
You need to be clever and cunning there

77
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:36,301
and if you're sitting here with me in this mine now

78
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,588
I'm sorry,

79
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:40,867
but you probably don't belong to that group, do you?

80
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:45,548
A Rogue isn't the kind of person who likes to earn an honest living

81
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:49,352
so better keep your pouch of ore close to you

82
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,867
when you're in their company... 

83
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,901
I advise you well!

84
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,281
The relationships between the Camps 

85
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:57,942
are tense enough 

86
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:01,406
for someone to care about your potential loss. 

87
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:03,491
Gomez will do anything

88
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,942
 to maintain the current order 

89
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:08,274
and not disrupt the ore trade.

90
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:11,188
Thanks to the exchanges with the outside world 

91
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:13,554
that desperately needs this resource

92
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:16,435
he has access to all goods 

93
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,035
and remains in power.

94
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:22,040
He dips his fingers into everyone's pockets, 

95
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,347
and even when 

96
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,813
he gives you ore, it eventually comes back to him. 

97
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:31,715
We diggers are just 

98
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:34,476
small cogs in this machine. 

99
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:36,115
And do you know why? NO?

100
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:37,134
I'll tell you:

101
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,436
 because we extract the ore.

102
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:43,266
Everything revolves around ore and power here, boy. 

103
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,963
The Ore Barons know it well. 

104
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,344
Some of the mined mineral 

105
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:49,216
stays in Gomez's vaults, 

106
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:53,433
and some, in the form of pay, goes to those who have earned it. 

107
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,112
Since the Brotherhood

108
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:58,353
developed a new method of drying Swampweed, 

109
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:01,978
money also flows in greater quantities there 

110
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,023
Because everyone comes

111
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,654
for our products ,

112
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,405
even the Guards,

113
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:11,109
who are happy to spend a few nuggets of ore on Green Novice.

114
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:13,066
As you might have guessed, 

115
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,654
the law of the fist rules in the Colony, 

116
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:19,456
So Novices on the course have to be careful. 

117
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,357
Otherwise,

118
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:22,849
the freshly earned ore 

119
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,723
will find new owners, namely the Rogues... 

120
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:28,028
which, by the way, suits Gomez,

121
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,256
who turns a blind eye to such incidents, 

122
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,264
even when they happen nearby.

123
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:35,164
After all, the Rogues 

124
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:39,008
will probably go get drunk in the tavern with the money they earned

125
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:40,691
they always do it.

126
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,622
For the Awakening of the Sleeper..! 

127
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,797
They just don't know that by giving money to the innkeeper

128
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:48,180
they strengthen the Old Camp's position,

129
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,306
because Gomez's Guards

130
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,193
 collect a hefty tax from the tavern.

131
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,148
Sometimes they take something extra

132
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:57,560
but that doesn't really matter 

133
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,665
because, in the end,, the ore finds its way back to one of the Ore Barons,

134
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:05,138
in other words, to Gomez. 

135
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:07,893
And the circle closes.

136
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:09,638
That's why he's 

137
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:12,981
the most powerful man in the Colony, boy. 

138
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,441
Because that damn ore always comes back to him.

139
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,966
While we, tired and dirty, 

140
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:22,387
dig deep underground to survive

141
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,138
he and the other Ore Barons

142
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:27,701
 sit at a well-laid table and give orders 

143
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:31,786
that can turn our lives upside down in an instant!

144
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:35,269
The cards have been dealt here for a long time.

145
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,357
Ambition won't get you far 

146
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:40,199
if you don't want to become someone's pawn in this game,

147
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,298
That's why it's better to do not stick out. Do your thing.

148
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,171
(in a fanatical voice) ONLY THE SLEEPER

149
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:47,830
CAN GET US OUT OF HERE...

150
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,035
I'M SURE OF IT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. 

151
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,407
SLEEPER! AWAKEN!

152
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:58,253
(in a normal voice again) Are you asking about the Mages?

153
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:01,887
Whether they have something to say here? (laugh)

154
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,457
They are wise 

155
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,433
and talented people, you say...?

156
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,333
The problem with intelligence is... 

157
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,328
that it doesn't like being confined in a magical prison 

158
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,911
with no escape, boy. 

159
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:17,593
Mages never liked getting involved in politics,

160
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:20,896
they're comfortable in their own world of religion, 

161
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:24,136
magic and ancient mysteries.

162
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:26,007
They're decent people, 

163
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,490
but entirely inaccessible to people like us. 

164
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,474
You can't count on anyone here, 

165
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:34,515
only on yourself...

166
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,422
The good news is that 

167
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,387
at least you won't die of hunger. 

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,723
No, as long as Snaf 

169
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:42,697
is the cook in the Old Camp. 

170
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,312
Oh, the Sleeper, 

171
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,452
nothing smells 

172
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:49,580
like his meatbug ragout! 

173
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,998
Half the Colony gathers to eat it. 

174
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:53,787
Snaf is an decent man, 

175
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,928
and as you've probably noticed, 

176
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:59,504
such people are rare here. 

177
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:01,590
He won't let you die of hunger,

178
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:04,377
even if they take away all your nuggets!

179
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:07,288
Better remember it well 

180
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:10,132
because it might save your life one day!

181
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:15,265
That's how our life looks like here...

182
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:18,468
But I seem to have digressed... 

183
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:23,083
I should probably tell you how I ended up here, shouldn't I? 

184
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,797
Well, I don't really like talking about it, though...

185
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,345
However... (breaks off)

186
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,133
(sound of kicking and breaking of a lamp)

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,314
Guard: Hey! Hey you! 

188
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:33,132
Freak, is that you? 

189
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,570
What the hell are you doing here at this time?!

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,224
Why didn't you leave the mine with the other miners from your shift??

191
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:43,289
Are you talking to yourself again?

192
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,257
Get out of here

193
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:50,055
before your mumbling attracts those damn minecrawlers to us!

194
00:08:50,055 --> 00:09:00,055
